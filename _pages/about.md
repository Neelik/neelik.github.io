Garrett is an avid learner who holds a BS and MS in Computer Science from Boise State University. His Master's thesis focused on re-ranking search results for children in the K-4th Grades (using the American education system). As a result, he is an experienced investigator with exposure to the intersections of Human-Computer Interaction, Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval, and Education with publications at top international conferences such as ACM RecSys and ECIR.

Before choosing the path of academia, Garrett worked as a software engineer/developer for a collection of startups. When not developing himself professionally, he enjoys reading novels, golf, American football, and video games.
