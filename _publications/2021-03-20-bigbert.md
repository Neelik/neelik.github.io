title: "BiGBERT: Classifying Educational Web Resources for Kindergarten-12th Grades"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-03-20-bigbert
excerpt: "In this paper, we present BiGBERT, a deep learning model that simultaneously examines URLs and snippets from web resources to determine their alignment with children’s educational standards. Preliminary results inferred from ablation studies and comparison with baselines and state-of-the-art counterparts, reveal that leveraging domain knowledge to learn domain-aligned contextual nuances from limited input data leads to improved identification of educational web resources."
