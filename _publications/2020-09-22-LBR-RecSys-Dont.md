collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-09-22-LBR-RecSys-Dont
excerpt: "We present the preliminary exploration we conducted to identify traits that can influence children's preferences in books. Findings offer insights for the design of recommender algorithms that would look beyond patterns inferred from traditional user-system interactions (eg, ratings) for recommendation purposes, since when it comes to children such data is rarely, if at all, available."

We present the preliminary exploration we conducted to identify traits that can influence childrenâ€™s preferences in books. Findings offer insights for the design of recommender algorithms that would look beyond patterns inferred from traditional user-system interactions (eg, ratings) for recommendation purposes, since when it comes to children such data is rarely, if at all, available.
