title: "In a Hurry: How Time Constraints and the Presentation of Web Search Results Affect User Behaviour and Experience"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-06-06-in-a-hurry
excerpt: "Time constraints are commonplace in our daily lives. While literature in recent years from the Information Retrieval (IR) community has increased our understanding of the effects of time constraints on search, practical effects on search outcomes have rarely been evaluated. Little is known about how different search interfaces influence search outcomes and experiences in time-constrained search. This constitutes a knowledge gap that we aim to address in our work. Through a pre-registered 4x4 between-subjects crowdsourced user study, we investigate the influence of four different interfaces (list view, grid-based view, absence of result snippets, and linear scanning pattern view) on search outcomes and experiences under imposed time constraints (no constraint and constraints at two, five, and eight minutes). Results from our study indicate that user task performance is considerably affected by time constraints. In addition, as time constraints are tightened, a trade-off between querying rates and click depths arises. While no interaction effects between SERP interfaces and time constraints were ultimately found, findings from this study form an essential foundation for future work on how search result presentation may assist those searchers under strict time constraints."

Time constraints are commonplace in our daily lives. While literature in recent years from the Information Retrieval (IR) community has increased our understanding of the effects of time constraints on search, practical effects on search outcomes have rarely been evaluated.
